# wordle-solver
A script that abuses simple statistics to attempt to solve the daily wordle puzzle and tweet its result on my twitter page (https://twitter.com/_diode_).

## Notes:
(Circa February 2022)  
After Wordle took the internet by storm, my programmer spirit animal took over and I decided to take the lazy approach to solving it. I use Python and selenium to deliver and read data from the Wordle webpage.
